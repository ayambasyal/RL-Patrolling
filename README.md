Optimizing Human Resource Allocation for City Law Enforcement using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

### Step 1 
Implementing single agent environment where the agent tries to go to the goal state

### Step 2 
Implementing multi agent environment where 2 agents try to catch each other

### Step 3 
The multi agent environment us set up in the way where the thieves have to choose to rob a house and run away from the cops while the cops have to catch the thieves. Implementation contains one thief and one cop

### Step 4
Multiple agents are now work togeather and in opposition each other.

### Step 5
The initial placement of police officers are now changed in a way such that highest value can be obtained which is handled by another algorithm that takes the policies in step 4 as the environment
