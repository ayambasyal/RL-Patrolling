# RL-Patrolling
Optimizing Human Resource Allocation for City Law Enforcement Using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

### Step 1 
Implementing single agent environment where the agent tries to go to the goal state

### Step 2 
Implementing a multi-agent environment where 2 agents try to catch each other

# left to complete 
### Step 3 
The multi-agent environment is set up in a way where the thieves have to choose to rob a house and run away from the cops while the cops have to catch the thieves. The implementation contains one thief and one cop

### Step 4
Multiple agents are now working together and in opposition to each other.

### Step 5
The initial placement of police officers is now changed in a way such that the highest value can be obtained which is handled by another algorithm that takes the policies in step 4 as the environment
